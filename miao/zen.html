          The Beauty of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> Design
        </h2>
      </div>
      <p>
        A demonstration of what can be accomplished through
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> -based design. Select any
        style sheet from the list to load it into this page.

      <h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
      <p>
        Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific
        tags, incompatible <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> s,
        broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> support, and
        abandoned browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved
        thanks to the tireless efforts of folk like the W3C, WaSP, and the major
        browser creators.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important
        lessons of the masters. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the
        time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with
        the web.
      </p>
      <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
      <p>
        There is a continuing need to show the power of
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>. The Zen Garden aims to
        excite, inspire, and encourage participation. To begin, view some of the
        existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style
        sheet into this very page. The
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Languages">HTML</abbr> remains the same,
        the only thing that has changed is the external
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> file. Yes, really.
      </p>
      <p>
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> allows complete and total
        control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be
        illustrated in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what
        it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to
        create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have
        contributed to the beauty of the web; we can always push it further.
      </p>
      <h3>Participation</h3>
      <p>
        Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this
        page, so strong <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> skills
        are necessary too, but the example files are commented well enough that
        even <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> novices can use them
        as starting points. Please see the
        <a href="#">
          <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>Resource Guide
        </a>
        for advanced tutorials and tips on working with
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Languages">HTML</abbr>. This may seem
        daunting at first if you’ve never worked this way before, but follow the
        listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a guide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Download the sample <a href="#">HTML</a> and <a href="#">CSS</a> to work
        on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please,
        don’t submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server
        under your control. <a href="#">Send us a link</a> to an archive of that
        file and all associated assets, and if we choose to use it we will
        download it and place it on our server.
      </p>
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>
        Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all
        refer to showing people how amazing
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> really can be. This site
        serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today,
        learning tool for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future
        techniques we can all look forward to.
      </p>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Where possible, we would like to see mostly
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet, level 1 and 2">CSS 1 & 2</abbr>
        usage.
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet, level 3 and 4">CSS 3 & 4</abbr>
        should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks
        should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> and not the latest
        bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only
        real requirement we have is that your
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> validates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have
        implemented <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> by now. When
        sticking to the guidelines you should see fairly consistent results
        across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on
        the web these days — especially when you factor in mobile —
        pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible across every platform. That’s
        okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at
        least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run
        by over 90% of the population).
      </p>
      <p>
        We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws.
        Please keep objectionable material to a minimum, and try to incorporate
        unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past the
        point of needing another garden-related design.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full
        copyright on your graphics (with limited exceptions, see
        <a href="#">submission guidelines</a> ), but we ask you release your
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> under a Creative Commons
        license identical to the <a href="#">one on this site</a> so that others
        may learn from your work.
